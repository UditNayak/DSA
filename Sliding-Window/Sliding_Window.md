# Sliding Window Patterns

Typically, there are four kinds of patterns observed in Sliding Window type questions:

1. **Constant Window**
2. **Longest Subarray / Substring where `<condition>`**
    - Example: Longest subarray with sum â‰¤ k
    - Concept of Expand & Shrink
    - Frequently asked in coding interviews
3. **Number of Subarrays where `<condition>`**
    - Solve using Pattern 2
4. **Find Shortest/Minimum Window where `<condition>`**
